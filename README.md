#### Basic navigation

This is a basic website with some functionality built in. 
The pages can be navigated by clicking on the corresponding element with the appropriate name in the navbar (Top) or the footer (Bottom of the page).

#### Saving Elements

When browsing on the main page (index.html), or on the Marketing page (marketing.html), you would encounter the save icon on specific page elements.

The save icon:
